[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a `<script>` tag.

In case you wonder, we have 2 backend systems here. For anything related to user (login, profile, preferences), the backend is built with **GO** [fork me here](https://github.com/sigit-prayoga/switr-backend-go).
For the swit service itself, we use **NodeJS** [check 'em out](https://github.com/sigit-prayoga/switr-backend).

**NOTE:** This project is also available in Angular 2 [here](https://github.com/sigit-prayoga/switr-web-angular2)
